# Twitterbot

@Alex_RT_bot

Twitterbot is exactly that. Like everthing i make its practice, this time to get the hang of tweepy. as of writing this it has been more than a year since i initially wrote it. writing this 12/27/20, according to twitter, @Alex_RT_bot was created in november 2019.
This is essentially a shitpost machine, i input a topic,how many times i want to retweet something with that phrase and it makes it happen. no real use besides, well, practicing using python for twitter.
must use atleast python3
